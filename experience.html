        <p> And now, I'm pursuing diploma studies at UiTM Rembau, majoring Information Management. During my diploma year, I joined the Komander Kesatria association in college. After joining the association, I was able to gain a lot of knowledge directly or indirectly. For example, I'm able to learn how to manage a big event when in semester 2, I also able to participate in programs either around or outside the campus. In addition, I can also learn how to divide study and work time. I learnt to adapt to a variety of group work people and environment. And what can I sum up is, they are my home when I'm in diploma. They are always have each other's side through ups and downs. This is my best experience that I've ever had.</p>
